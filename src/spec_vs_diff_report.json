  "summary": "The diff implements the requested answered-screen image swap (including updated alt text), adds a bottom “Love you / Happy Rose Day kannu” message, and introduces additional user-gesture-triggered sound effects including a sound on celebration modal close. However, the diff also includes several extra styling/theme and configuration changes (and references an additional background image asset) that were not requested.",
