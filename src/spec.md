# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the “Yes” answered screen to show a single rose-giving stick-figure illustration, add a new bottom love message, and expand user-gesture-triggered sound effects.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the answered-screen illustration with a single-scene asset showing a male stick figure giving a rose to a female stick figure, and update the image alt text accordingly.
- Replace the answered-screen footer with a bottom-aligned message that includes “Love you” and the exact text “Happy Rose Day kannu”, ensuring it’s readable and doesn’t overlap the image (including on iPad Chrome).
- Add additional low-volume, user-gesture-safe sound triggers, including a sound when the celebration modal is closed via its close interaction.

**User-visible outcome:** After tapping “Yes! 🌹”, the user sees only the rose-giving illustration with a bottom love message (“Love you” and “Happy Rose Day kannu”), and more interactions (including closing the celebration modal) play subtle sounds only when tapped/clicked.
